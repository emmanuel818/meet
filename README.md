# Meet App

This application will build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development technique. 
The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

## Key Features

* Filter events by city.
* Show/hide event details.
* Specify number of events.
* Use the app when offline.
* Add an app shorcut to the home screen.
* View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city.

## User Stories

* As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that
take place in that city.
- Scenario 1: When user hasn’t searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities.
- Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city.
- Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list.
* As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less
information about an event.
- Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default.
- Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see its details.
- Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide its details.
* As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so
that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.
- Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 is the default number
- Scenario 2: User can change the number of events they want to see
* As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I
viewed the last time I was online.
- Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection
- Scenario 2: Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range)
* As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can
open the app faster.
* As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so
that I know what events are organized in which city.
- Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city
